                <p class="text-faded">At Codes without Borders, we are fully commited to raising Nigeria's next generation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer" target="_blank" style=" color: white">Programmers</a>, if there was ever one. We believe in the unalienable right of access of the Nigerian child to, at least, basic useful computer science education, because we know as a matter of fact, that no matter their eventual chosen career, computers and technology will play a central role. We believe that arming the young ones with adequate computer science education will go a long way in developing their critical thinking ability which is a neccessary prerequisite for nation building. We intend to achieve our aims, through raising awareness that every child can learn how to code regardless of what they eventually study in the university and building a strong advocacy for modernization of the computer science curriculum in Nigerian schools. We would be glad if you contribute to the cause.</p>
