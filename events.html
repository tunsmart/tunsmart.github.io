            <p>On 2015, December 9, we visited Ishaga Close Primary School for the <a href="https://hourofcode.com/">Hour Of Code</a>. It was a fun filled event, where primary six students were introduced to the rudiments of computer programming -- Sequence, Loops, Events, through interactive games... It was a smashing success! Over 70 kids participated in the event, facilitated by over 30 Volunteers.</p>
